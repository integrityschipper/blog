### Coding!

Happy New Years! I'm going to kick it off with a two-week learning sprint, and I'm going to try to cover:

- markdown
- bash
- rust
- python
- html
- css
- javascript
- sql
- postgresql
- react
- nextjs
- fastapi
- vite
- redis, and
- caddy

... which is the pared-down list, lol.

After two weeks I'm going to reevaluate, all in on this for a bit though while I work my way through the first couple of paychecks since being super broke, see about sobriety for a bit, at least before the work party on the 18th, and I'm not going to hold myself to that religiously, I'm done with every attempt at sobriety, or endeavor, or new years resolution, always ending in shame. Enough. Two weeks of hardcore learning, and I'm going to do my best and be kind to myself.

First step was editing the window manager shortcut for minimizing and maximizing windows, I understand alt-f10 is a standard for some reason, but it has the tiling mapped to super- and then the keypad, so super-9 tiles to the top left, and now super-5 is maximize and super-0 is minimize. The nonsense I accepted as normal when I was drunk and dissociated needs to end. I'm smart and capable and I can **do** this.

VS Code supports markdown out the box, and I downloaded the cheatsheet for the thousandth time, made the blog folder, next let me just check my git commands, set that up, then dive into everything I can make a variable in.
